## Paint-Project

This project was created using Python and an online Tutorial by Tech With Tim

Tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N20eXcfyQ_4&ab_channel=TechWithTim

I have added my own personal documentation and have already started adding a 
lot of personal changes and new additions to the code. I eventually want to
change how a lot of it is formatted so it becomes more my own. Since this is
one of my first ever side projects and first ever times using Pygame, I thought
following a tutorial would be a great idea.
